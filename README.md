# Cloud-based_Big_Data_Systems-_Project


## Introduction
This is my 721 project 3, a Cloud-based Big Data Systems Project. I used a dataset about human stress detection of more than two thousand samples. Three metrics, including human body humidity, body temperature and the number of steps, are used to classify the stress level of human. Stress level is divided into three categories, low stress, normal stress, and high stress. 

## How did I implement it
I downloaded the dataset about human stress detection from kaggle, uploaded it onto Databricks, created table UI of it. Then did the AutoML experiment to train the model and got different models. I picked one of them registered as my ML model and used it in Notebook.
